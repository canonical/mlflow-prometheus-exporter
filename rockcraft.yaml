summary: MLflow Prometheus Exporter Image
description: |
  The Docker image for the Prometheus Python exporter for MLflow is a self-contained package 
  that collects and exposes custom metrics from MLflow servers. It integrates seamlessly with 
  MLflow deployments, leveraging the MLflow REST API to gather metrics such as registered 
  models and deployments. By deploying this image as a containerized service, users can 
  enhance observability and streamline monitoring and analysis workflows for MLflow using 
  Prometheus and the Observability Stack.
